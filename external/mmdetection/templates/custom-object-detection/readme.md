# Custom object detector

Custom object detectors are object detection models with accuracy-complexity trade-off that have been pre-trained on MS COCO object detection dataset.
It is assumed that one will use these pre-trained models as starting points in order to train specific object detection models (e.g. 'cat' and 'dog' detection).
*NOTE* There was no goal to train top-scoring lightweight 80 class (MS COCO classes) detectors here,
but rather provide pre-trained checkpoints for further fine-tuning on a target dataset.
